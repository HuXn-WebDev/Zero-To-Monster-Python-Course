**1. Guessing Game**

- **Challenge:** Develop a program that lets a user guess a secret number.
- **Functionality:**
  - Define a secret number (or store it in a variable).
  - Use a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for guesses.
  - Inside the loop:
    - Check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
    - Provide feedback to the user based on their guess.
  - When the guess is correct, print a congratulatory message.

**2. Menu-Driven Program (While Loop Version)**

- **Challenge:** Rewrite the menu-driven program using a `while` loop.
- **Functionality:**
  - Create a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.
  - Inside the loop:
    - Display a menu with options (e.g., add, subtract, exit).
    - Use `if` statements to handle different menu options and perform the corresponding actions (add, subtract, etc.).

**3. Countdown Timer**

- **Challenge:** Create a program that simulates a countdown timer.
- **Functionality:**
  - Prompt the user to enter a starting time in seconds.
  - Use a `while` loop with a counter variable.
  - Inside the loop:
    - Decrement the counter variable by 1 (simulating one second passing).
    - Print the remaining time.
  - Once the counter reaches 0, print a message like "Time's up!"

**Note:** Functionality like `time.sleep(1)` might not be available in all environments.

This organization clarifies the purpose and steps involved in each challenge.
